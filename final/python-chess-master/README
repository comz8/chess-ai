CMPUT 275 Final Project - Python Chess Game
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For our final project, we decided to make a player versus computer implementation
of chess using the pygame library for Python. It includes all the essential rules
for chess. The computer player uses the minimax strategy with alpha-beta pruning
for generating and deciding moves. It explores all possible moves, then explores
their possible moves and so on. This essentially creates a search tree to a depth of 3.
The best move is decided by evaluating the 'score' of the board. A graphical
representation of the board is rendered with a side menu with contextual tips,
that displays useful information such as whose turn it is, if the move you're
attempting is invalid, if someone is in check, among other things.
The mouse is used to select pieces and move them. The program only allows you
to make valid moves according to the rules of chess, and also includes the
special moves: castling, and promotion. The program automatically detects check
and checkmate, and for the latter, ends the game and declares the winner.

For more specific instructions on how to play, see 'Usage Instructions'.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Setup Instructions:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
These instructions are for the VM used in class.

Download and unzip the file.
Open a terminal in the main directory (the one containing chess.py).
Install pygame by running
--------------------------------
|   sudo pip install pygame    |
--------------------------------
You will be prompted to enter the VM's password. It's 'cmput274'.

Once pygame is installed, run the game by

----------------------------------
|    python3 chess.py           |
----------------------------------

That's it!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Usage Instructions:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Moving A Piece On Your Turn:
Use the mouse to select one of your pieces and then select the square you want to move it to.
If you selected one of your pieces, the square that piece is on will be highlighted
by a purple square.
If you choose an invalid place to move to, a message will be displayed informing
you of the rule infringement, and you will be able to try again. If you decide
to not move this piece, just select it again to cancel the move, and the purple
square will go away to indicate that you deselected that piece.

Checking:
If your opponent places you in check, a message will be displayed informing you
that you are in check. Your next move MUST get you out of the check. If you attempt
to make a move that doesn't get you out of check, a warning message will be
displayed, and the move will not be allowed. Once you get out of check, the game
proceeds as normal.

Checkmate/End Game:
If there is indeed a checkmate, the game will end and the
winner will be displayed. To play again, close the game, and run it again.

Castling:
If the rook and the king have not yet moved, the spaces are empty between them,
none of the in betweens or the new location of the king are in check,
you can castle. To perform the castling maneuver, select your king, and then
select the square where the king moves in the castling maneuver, and the move
will be performed automatically.

Refer to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castling
for valid criteria for castling, if you are unfamiliar with this rule.

Promotion:
If one of your pawns reaches the opposite end of the board, it will automatically
be promoted to a queen.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
File Layout / Description:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

chess.py:
Run this if you want to play the game. It contains the main game logic loop.

modules/pieces.py:
Contains all the chess piece classes. Each piece type (such as rook, queen) is
a subclass of the generic piece class, which inherits from the pygame Sprite class.
Each piece contains a move generator, that generates all the legal moves for that piece.

modules/board.py:
Contains the board class, which is a representation of the board in a 8x8 array.
Instances of the piece class will be in the array. If a square is empty, the
square will have 'None'

modules/computer.py:
Responsible for move generation and the computer player's 'brain'. Contains a
move generation function that generates all the pseudo-legal moves for a board
state.
Contains the minimax with alpha beta pruning algorithm, which is the heart of
how the computer selects the best move.

assets/:
Contains picture assets used in the game.

The camstream() function is modified from a gist. It's used to take a picture of
the player. https://gist.github.com/snim2/255151

The assets/draw_chessboard.py function is modified from a gist as well.
It generates the background chess board image using pillow
(since the image is already generated, there is no need to install pillow)
